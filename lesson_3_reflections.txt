When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To help syncing work across multiple devices and locations or collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Keeping the latest changes in the cloud (on Github) allows the master branch to be easily shared accross multiple devices and collaborators.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork clone a Github repository to a new one so that the user can use another person's project as a base to their own project. A clone is a more general Git term for cloning a repository to another location. A branch is another version within the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows the code to be accessed even when the user is offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Cloud storage services could be used such as Dropbox or Google Docs but the version control is not as advanced, allowing only to change one file at a time. It would make minute changes easier though since it wouldn't involve going back and forth between participants with pull requests.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

If the changes are so many that they would need to be incorporated into a different version of the program while maintianing a more stable version of the program in master.
