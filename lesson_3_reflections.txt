When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To help syncing work across multiple devices and locations or collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Keeping the latest changes in the cloud (on Github) allows the master branch to be easily shared accross multiple devices and collaborators.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork clone a Github repository to a new one so that the user can use another person's project as a base to their own project. A clone is a more general Git term for cloning a repository to another location. A branch is another version within the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows the code to be accessed even when the user is offline.
