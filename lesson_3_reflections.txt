When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To help syncing work across multiple devices and locations or collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Keeping the latest changes in the cloud (on Github) allows the master branch to be easily shared accross multiple devices and collaborators.
